**Timeline: 4-6 weeks**
â€¢ Week 1-2: Job posting & sourcing
â€¢ Week 3-4: Initial screening & technical assessments  
â€¢ Week 5-6: Final interviews & offers

**Key Requirements to Define:**
â€¢ Programming languages (Java, Python, C++?)
â€¢ Specific projects they'll work on
â€¢ Mentorship structure you'll provide
â€¢ Duration (summer, semester, full-year?)

**Where to Post:**
â€¢ University career centers
â€¢ GitHub Students, HackerRank
â€¢ LinkedIn, Indeed with "intern" keyword
â€¢ Tech meetups and career fairs

What's your timeline for this hire? And do you have a specific tech stack in mind?`;

â€¢ Git/version control familiarity

**Other Considerations:**
â€¢ Course credit vs. paid position
