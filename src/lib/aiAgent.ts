What type of role are you looking to fill? The approach can vary quite a bit depending on whether you're hiring for:
â€¢ Technical roles (developers, engineers)
â€¢ Sales and marketing positions  
â€¢ Leadership or executive roles
â€¢ Entry-level vs. senior positions

Once I know more about the specific role, I can give you much more targeted advice! What's the position you're working on?`;

Are you dealing with a lot of applications and need help filtering them down? Or do you have some promising candidates and want to know the best way to evaluate them?

A quick question: What's the role you're screening for? The screening approach is quite different for a software engineer versus a sales rep, for example.`;

    if (lowerMessage.includes("interview")) {

Tell me more about where you are in the process:
â€¢ Are you designing the interview structure from scratch?
â€¢ Do you need help with specific interview questions?
â€¢ Are you trying to improve your current interview process?
â€¢ Is this for phone screens, technical interviews, or final rounds?

What's your biggest challenge with interviews right now?`;

What specifically are you trying to figure out?
â€¢ Setting a competitive salary range for a role?
â€¢ Your overall hiring budget and costs?
â€¢ How to negotiate offers effectively?
â€¢ Benchmarking against market rates?

Also, what role/level are we talking about? That makes a huge difference in the numbers!`;

What industry or role are you curious about? The job market varies wildly - tech is still competitive for senior roles, while other sectors have cooled down quite a bit.

Are you trying to:
â€¢ Understand how long hiring might take?
â€¢ Set competitive compensation?
â€¢ Figure out where to find the best candidates?
â€¢ Beat your competition to top talent?

Give me some details and I'll share what I know about the current landscape!`;

I want to make sure I give you the most helpful advice possible. Could you tell me a bit more about:
â€¢ What's your current situation?
â€¢ What specific challenge are you trying to solve?
â€¢ What type of role or company are we talking about?

The more context you give me, the better I can tailor my advice to your exact needs!`;
